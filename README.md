# Eat-Da-Burger

1. review code on github repo -- https://github.com/Itsacoup/Eat-Da-Burger
2. test app on heroku -- https://peaceful-reef-39270.herokuapp.com/

Did not have much time to execute this homework to my full capabilities since this was a difficult homework and project 2 started this week, 
plus considerations I had to take in real life. No time to comment code or write a good read me, or style the project very well. All backend functionality 
works though and I feel that is what was appropriate for this assignment, please consider when grading. Thank you.
